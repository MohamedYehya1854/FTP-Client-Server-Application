## Overview

This project is a simple implementation of an **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)** server and client application in C#. The server manages client connections, authenticates users, and handles file uploads, downloads, directory navigation, and listings. The client provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with the server.

The system uses TCP sockets for communication between the server and client, following a basic FTP-like protocol.

## Features

### Server Features
- **Authentication**: Supports username (`std`) and password (`123`) authentication.
- **Directory Navigation**: Allows clients to change directories (`CWD`) and navigate back (`CWD ..`).
- **File Operations**:
  - List files and directories (`LIST`).
  - Upload files to the server (`STOR`).
  - Download files from the server (`RETR`).
- **Multi-threading**: Handles multiple clients concurrently using `ThreadPool`.
- **Error Handling**: Provides meaningful error messages for invalid commands or unexpected issues.

### Client Features
- **GUI-Based Interface**: User-friendly interface built using Windows Forms.
- **File Management**:
  - Browse server directories.
  - Download files from the server.
  - Upload files to the server.
- **Status Updates**: Displays real-time status updates for all operations.
- **Navigation**: Navigate through directories and move back to parent directories.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main components:

1. **FTPServer**:
   - Implemented in `Server App.txt`.
   - A console application that listens for incoming client connections on port `21` (control port) and `20` (data port).

2. **FTPClient**:
   - Implemented in `Form1.txt` (logic) and `Form1 Designer.txt` (GUI design).
   - A Windows Forms application that provides a GUI for interacting with the FTP server.

## How It Works

### Server

#### Key Components
- **Control Port (Port 21)**: Handles client commands like authentication, directory listing, and navigation.
- **Data Port (Port 20)**: Handles file transfers (uploads and downloads).
- **Concurrent Clients**: Uses `ConcurrentDictionary` to manage active clients and their current directories.

#### Workflow
1. **Startup**:
   - The server starts listening on port `21` for incoming connections.
   - Each client connection is handled in a separate thread using `ThreadPool`.

2. **Authentication**:
   - Clients must provide a valid username (`std`) and password (`123`) to access the server.

3. **Commands**:
   - **LIST**: Lists files and directories in the current directory.
   - **CWD**: Changes the current working directory.
   - **RETR**: Sends a file to the client.
   - **STOR**: Receives a file from the client.
   - **EXIT**: Disconnects the client.

4. **File Transfers**:
   - File transfers occur over port `20` using a separate `TcpListener` for each transfer.

### Client

#### Key Components
- **GUI**: Built using Windows Forms with controls for connecting to the server, listing files, uploading/downloading files, and navigating directories.
- **Communication**: Communicates with the server using `TcpClient` over port `21` (control) and port `20` (data).

#### Workflow
1. **Connection**:
   - The user enters the server IP address, username, and password.
   - The client connects to the server and authenticates the user.

2. **Directory Listing**:
   - The `LIST` command retrieves files and directories from the server.
   - Files and directories are displayed in separate list boxes.

3. **File Operations**:
   - **Download**: Select a file from the list and download it to the local machine.
   - **Upload**: Select a file from the local machine and upload it to the server.

4. **Navigation**:
   - Open folders by selecting them from the folder list.
   - Move back to the parent directory using the "Back" button.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- **.NET Framework**: Ensure you have .NET Framework installed on your system.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ftp-server-client.git
   cd ftp-server-client
   ```

2. Build the Projects:
   - Open the solution in Visual Studio.
   - Build both the server and client projects.

3. Configure Root Directory:
   - Update the `RootDirectory` variable in `Server App.txt` to point to your desired root directory:
     ```csharp
     private static string RootDirectory = @"C:\Your\Root\Directory";
     ```

4. Run the Server:
   - Execute the server application to start listening for connections.

5. Run the Client:
   - Launch the client application and connect to the server using the appropriate IP address.

## Usage

### Server
1. Start the server application.
2. The server will display logs for client connections, disconnections, and operations.

### Client
1. Enter the server IP address (default: `127.0.0.1`), username (`std`), and password (`123`).
2. Click "Connect" to establish a connection.
3. Use the buttons to:
   - **List**: View files and directories.
   - **Download**: Save a file from the server to your local machine.
   - **Upload**: Send a file from your local machine to the server.
   - **Open Folder**: Navigate into a directory.
   - **Back**: Move to the parent directory.
